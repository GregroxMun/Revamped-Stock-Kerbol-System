			description = Jool is the fifth major planet from the Sun and is the largest planet in the solar system. Boasting three large moons, a huge mass, and a startlingly green color, this planet is quite the sight. It has swirling green cloud forms and occasional storms. It is believed to be made largely of gasses left over from the Sun's formation, as made evident by high concentrations of the light gasses Hydrogen and Helium in its atmosphere. Observations in the radio and microwave spectrum of light suggest that Jool has a very powerful magnetic field that would produce dangerous ionizing radiation around the inner three moons. Sometimes, radios pick up the spooky signals this magnetic field generates, and sometimes makes Kerbals go insane.

		@Properties
		{
			description = Pol is a very unique object orbiting Jool. Its comparatively low density suggests that it is a rubble pile, a bundle of rocks that happen to be flying in the same orbit, held together by what is probably fair to say is only partly gravity. Before it was discovered, it often confused astronomers who thought they were looking at Gobe. It was only after one astronomer realized that they could see two Gobes together that she realized that this must be a separate object. Its surface is a strange muddle of yellows, browns, all in a very confusing and mysterious unknown composition. No one has ever been able to figure out for certain what the darned surface is made of. Three separate studies returned totally different planet-wide surface compositions, ranging from stony to icy to organic composition. The only way to tell for sure what the darned surface is made from would be to retrieve a sample directly.

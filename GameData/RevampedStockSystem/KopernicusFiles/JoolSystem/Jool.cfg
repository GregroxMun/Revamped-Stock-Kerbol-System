			description = Jool is the fifth major planet from the Sun and is the largest planet in the solar system. Boasting three large moons, a huge mass, and a startlingly green color, this planet is quite the sight. It has swirling green cloud forms and occasional storms. It is believed to be made largely of gasses left over from the Sun's formation, as made evident by high concentrations of the light gasses Hydrogen and Helium in its atmosphere. Observations in the radio and microwave spectrum of light suggest that Jool has a very powerful magnetic field that would produce dangerous ionizing radiation around the inner three moons. Sometimes, radios pick up the spooky signals this magnetic field generates, and sometimes makes Kerbals go insane.

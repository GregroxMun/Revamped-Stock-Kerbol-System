			description = Duna is a small, red planet, fourth in distance from the Sun. Its red color is thought to be due to an iron-rust rich soil. Its tenuous atmosphere is likely heavy in carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and very very thin. Duna has very large dry-ice and water ice caps, which may hold the potential for simple forms of life. Compared to the toxic environment of Eve and the radioactive environment of Laythe, Duna is thought to be the second best planet in the Solar System for supporting life. For this reason, Duna has long been a wonder to Kerbalkind.

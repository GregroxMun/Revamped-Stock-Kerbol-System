			description = The Mun is a large, grey, spherical moon orbiting Kerbin. Because it is tidally locked, only one side faces Kerbin, and the other is permanently hidden from view. It is one of the most visible objects in the sky, and can be seen during night or day, depending on its phase. Telescopic observations of the Mun's near-side surface shows a lot of craters marking what would otherwise be a smooth surface. What causes these craters is still a subject of great controversy in the scientific community. One group believes the Mun's craters are volcanic, while those who see the lack of any volcanic gasses vehemently suggest that the craters are caused by impacts. Whatever they are, they would certainly pose a challenge to land in.

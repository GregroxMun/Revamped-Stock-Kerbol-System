			description = Kerbin is a large world with tall mountains, rolling green plains, sandy brown deserts, and wide blue seas. It was long thought that Kerbin was the center of the universe. It took a surprisingly long time to figure out that Kerbin was not the center of everything. Kerbin is the home of all known life, including the Kerbals. The conditions of the surface of Kerbin seem to support a vast and seemingly undepletable population of the competent, though impatient and foresight-lacking creatures. Reaching an orbit around Kerbin is a major achievement. As the saying goes: "Once you're in orbit around Kerbin, you're halfway to anywhere!"

			description = Ike is a large grey moon orbiting Duna. Ike and Duna are very similar in size, which has led many astronomers to consider the Duna-Ike system to be a double planet system and not a planet-moon system. Dynamic computer analysis of the Duna-Ike system shows that Ike seems to be perfectly positioned to interfere with any spacecraft that presume to orbit near its parent. For this reason, Ike has won the spaceflight engineer's award for "Most Hated Planet and/or Moon." Duna and Ike are tidally locked to each other, so only one side of Duna sees Ike, and vice versa.
